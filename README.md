Snake game in C and Python done in L2 and L1 *(in French sorry guys)*

# Wat is dis

Do you know snake ? Yes ! Well that's it, bye ! ðŸ‘‹

More seriously this is the 2 snakes that i've made in the first two years of university.

# Python

The first one is in Python and have power up, multi-player and cool things.

The game starts when you run `snake.py`, the second file is only the 

# C

The second one is in C (done with Luca) and has multi-player and gold and poisonous apple (the red one with leaf).

To run this project you need to install [this library](http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~boussica/mlv/api/French/html/index.html).

Then run the file `lancement_rapide.sh` and enjoy.
